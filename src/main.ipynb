Under-resourced institutions may therefore be unable\\nto reap the full benefits of machine learning applications despite\\ncommonly having the greatest need. Externally developed mod-\\nels have increasingly been adopted in these cases to address this\\nchallenge. While this highlights a potential benefit of sharing pre-\\ndictive models within large-scale cross-institutional collaborations,\\nthe risks and benefits of cross-institutional modeling are not well\\nunderstood, particularly in terms of the potential impact on the\\nmost vulnerable populations affected by these models.\\nWe investigate the benefits and risks of cross-institutional trans-\\nfer in the context of an important and pervasive application of\\nmachine learning in education: university student dropout predic-\\ntion. Every year, over one million students drop out of college in the\\nUnited States, and they are 100 times more likely to default on their\\nstudent loan payments than those who graduate [46]. This leaves\\nyoung adults with a major financial burden and little to improve\\ntheir job prospects with an incomplete degree [66]. Dropout rates\\nare especially high for students from minority groups2, exacerbat-\\ning existing inequities.\\n2https://nces.ed.gov/programs/raceindicators/indicator_red.asp\\n1664\\n'"
